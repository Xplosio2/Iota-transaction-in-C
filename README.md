# Iota-transaction-in-C
able to make a transaction bundle with arduino

I am trying to create a transaction bundle in C for Arduino devices. The code compiles successfully, however the Arduino is showing some encrypted outputs. 

!The project is still under construction and it would be great if some of you would help to fix the problem!
